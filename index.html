            <p>
              In 2005, my tech odyssey began with a help desk position on a Navy
              contract, marking the start of a journey driven by my innate
              proficiency with computers. This early stage was more about
              survival in the tech world than realizing its vast potential.
              <br /><br />
              My career between 2005 and 2016 was predominantly in DoD contracts
              and Microsoft enterprise environments in Hampton Roads, VA. A
              turning point came when my wife embarked on her PhD journey,
              prompting our move to the West Coast. This led me to Jet.com, a
              dynamic e-commerce startup later acquired by Walmart. My role
              there, and subsequently at Walmart's global email team, involved
              building and supporting expansive infrastructures across the US
              and in Dublin, Ireland. However, I yearned for the rapid learning
              and pace that Jet offered.
              <br /><br />
              This desire for continuous growth and challenge inspired my shift
              in 2020 towards software engineering. As I delve deeper into this
              field, my current work in DevOps, site reliability engineering,
              and platform engineering has become a cornerstone of my
              professional development. These roles, blending rigorous technical
              skills with innovative problem-solving, are preparing me for my
              ultimate goal: to integrate my comprehensive background in
              infrastructure, operations, and software development into a
              software engineering role that continuously evolves and challenges
              the norm.
              <br /><br />
              Every step of this journey, from help desk to high-level
              engineering, has been a building block towards a future where I
              can fully leverage my diverse experiences in a role at the
              forefront of technological advancement.

            <p>
              In my role as a Solutions Architect at the insuretech startup
              Cover Whale, I immediately recognized the necessity to implement
              modern software and DevOps best practices. A primary objective was
              to standardize our cloud infrastructure through infrastructure as
              code. Initially, Terraform was the standard choice, but as we
              ventured towards platform engineering, I encountered resistance
              from the engineering organization regarding the use of a
              domain-specific language.
              <br /><br />
              This challenge led me to explore alternatives that aligned with
              our operational goals and team dynamics. Our exploration
              culminated in the adoption of Pulumi, a decision that profoundly
              resonated with our team’s ethos. Pulumi not only felt organic in
              its application but also marked a significant milestone in our
              understanding and implementation of DevOps principles.
              <br /><br />
              Our engineering team has significantly benefited from this shift,
              experiencing enhanced collaboration and breakdown of silos. The
              foundation we built with Pulumi has been instrumental in our
              success, fostering a more integrated and efficient working
              environment. This journey with Pulumi has been a testament to the
              power of choosing the right tools that align with both our
              technical needs and team culture.
              <br /><br />
              As part of my current role, I am responsible for maintaining an
              internal library of Pulumi components, a critical task that
              involves expertise in Golang, TypeScript, and Python. This library
              forms the backbone of our deployment and management processes for
              cloud infrastructure within AWS. Its design and implementation are
              pivotal in ensuring that our internal teams can work efficiently
              and productively.
              <br /><br />
              Furthermore, the library plays a vital role in adhering to
              regulatory compliance requirements, an aspect crucial to our
              operational integrity. By providing robust and compliant
              infrastructure solutions, the library I maintain not only
              streamlines our internal processes but also reinforces our
              commitment to meeting industry standards.
              <br /><br />
              I am passionate about exploring new technologies and continuously
              expanding my skill set. Currently, I am deepening my proficiency
              in Golang while simultaneously delving into Rust, a language I
              find fascinating and remarkably complementary to Golang. Rust's
              unique features and capabilities have captured my interest,
              especially with the recent launch of the AWS SDK for Rust.
              <br /><br />
              This development has sparked my curiosity about integrating Rust
              with Pulumi. I am eager to explore the potential synergies between
              these technologies and assess the feasibility of bringing Rust
              into the Pulumi ecosystem. I believe that combining Rust's
              performance and safety features with Pulumi's
              infrastructure-as-code capabilities could unlock new possibilities
              and efficiencies in cloud infrastructure management.

                        I'm always interested in learning and progressively getting better every day. I'm lucky to
                        have
                        a supportive family and professional team that affords me this opportunity. I think the best
